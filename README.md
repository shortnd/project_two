## Technologies Used
The technologies used in this project was Ruby on the Rails, and has some HTML and CSS. All testing was done on Google Chrome.

## Approach Taken
My approach taken for this app was to make a app where a user could register for an upcoming event and view the event information. They could also delete and edit if they choose not to go the the event.


## Installation instructions

##### Required Software
Google Chrome, Ruby, Bundle, and Ruby on Rails

## Downloading
If you download the repository to run the app locally you will have to have ruby, bundle and ruby on rails installed in order to run the app.

## User Stores

As a user I should be able to register for upcoming regional(event)

As an Admin I should be able to see all users who have registered for each regional

As an Admin I should be able to see all information about each family that is registered

As a User I should be able to edit my registration after submitting it if there is an error

As an Admin I should be able to Edit and Delete Registration submissions after I am done with them.

As a User I should only be able to view my Registration and no one else's as they shouldn't be able to see mine either
